# Data Structures and Algorithms

I love programming languages. At the same time, I am not exactly the best at data structures and algorithms, but I would like to be better. So, this project aims to hit two birds with one stone, explore languages and get better at data structures and algorithms.

The language that I mainly work with is JavaScript. Further, I have some experience with PHP and Pascal. So, I will probably add those here. However, I would also like to explore low-level languages such as C and Rust and functional languages like Haskell and Clojure.

In this spirit of language exploration, I intend to only use the vanilla, base form of whatever language I will explore, meaning no external and non-default libraries, even for testing.

## Disclaimer

**Do not use the code in this repository for production.**

I will try to be as thorough as I can in testing, but as I am primarily doing this for fun, there will probably be bugs and edge cases that I will miss. Additionally, I intend to reinvent a lot of wheels for educational purposes. As such, if you are tempted to use anything here for a project, do not. Find and use a battle-tested library instead.

That said, if your goal is to play around and learn along with me, then feel free to clone or fork this repository and use it however you like.

## Directory structure

Each subdirectory maps to a programming language and contains a readme file that details instructions and requirements for running the code.

## Contributing

Since one of the main goals of this project is for me to learn data structures and algorithms, I will not accept pull requests that implement them because I want to do that myself. However, I will greatly appreciate suggestions on languages, data structures, and algorithms to explore as well as fixes or improvements to the things that I have already implemented.
